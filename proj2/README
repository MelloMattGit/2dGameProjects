Project description: logo for the game Dota 2

The easiest part of this project: the math of drawing the triangles and making
  the logo scale to the size of the window

Problems that I had in completing this project: had issues using the different
  make files and classes provided in examples, linking problems, and
  finding a need for a self made class
